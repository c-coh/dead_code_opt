Test eliminating assignments from all major classes of nodes (expressions and statements)
Test variable uses in various types of dataflow structures
Test unreachable code in if, for, and while statements

Tests:
    test1:
        Tested variable uses in all major classes of nodes without dataflow complexities
        Classes Tested:
            Statement blocks
            Return statements
            Binary expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and, or, comparison)
            Unary expressions (int to float, float to int, int to bool, bool to int, negation)
            Function calls
            Assignment statements
        Relevant Lines:
            Line 15: Variable use in unary expression (int to float)
            Line 16: Variable use in assignment
            Line 18: Variable use in binary expression (comparison)
            Line 19: Variable use in function call
            Line 24: Variable use in return statement
    test2:
        Tested dead variables in all major classes of nodes without dataflow complexities
        Classes Tested:
            Statement blocks
            Return statements
            Binary expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and, or, comparison)
            Unary expressions (int to float, float to int, int to bool, bool to int, negation)
            Function calls
            Assignment statements
        Relevant Lines:
            Line 13: Dead assignment in statement block
            Line 14: Dead assignment in binary expression (addition)
            Line 15: Dead assignment in assignment statement
            Line 16: Dead assignment in unary operator (int to float)
            Line 17: Dead assignment in function call
            Line 18: Dead assignment in return statement
    test3:
        Tested variables dead through one and through all dataflow paths of if statements
        Tested variables dead through for loop body execution only and through all dataflow paths
        Tested variables dead through for loop body execution only and through all dataflow paths
        Relevant Lines:
            Line 13: Variable dead through one dataflow path only (then)
            Line 18: Variable dead through all dataflow paths (reassigned after if statement)
            Line 20: Dead assignment in if statement
            Line 24: Variable dead through one dataflow path only (else)
            Line 30: Variable dead through all dataflow paths (then and else)
            Line 38: Variable dead through for loop body only
            Line 43: Variable dead on all paths through for loop
            Line 45: Dead assignment in for loop
            Line 49: Variable dead through while loop body only
            Line 56: Variable dead on all paths through while loop
            Line 59: Dead assignment in while loop
    test4:
        Tested unreachable code in if, for, and while statements
        Note: Due to checking for an always-true loop condition, test case should be compiled but not run
    test5:
        Tested corner cases such as dead assignments with function calls or live assignments as their right-hand side
